## `<canvas>`

Usually make your canvases half their actual width using css in order to keep sharpness up on retina displays

Used when you're going to draw stuff to the browser, but `div`s aren't going to cut it

The context is where we do the drawing: `getContext(2d)`

## Destructuring

When you are making variables with names that correspond to properties already attached to an element, you can destructure it. So instead of:

```javascript
const width = canvas.height;
const height = canvas.width;
```

you can:

```javascript
const { width, height } = canvas;
```

## Randomness

`Math.random()` will give you random numbers in the range [0, 1)

## Note

A lot of developers, when defining a variable that is a true constant, eschew camelCase for ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE

## Switch statements

```javascript
switch (key) {
  default:
    break;
  case `ArrowUp`:
    y -= MOVE_AMOUNT;
    break;
  case `ArrowDown`:
    y += MOVE_AMOUNT;
    break;
  case `ArrowRight`:
    x += MOVE_AMOUNT;
    break;
  case `ArrowLeft`:
    x -= MOVE_AMOUNT;
    break;
}
```

## Stopping listeners

If you pass `{ once: true}` as a third param for addEventListener, it will only attach the listener once
