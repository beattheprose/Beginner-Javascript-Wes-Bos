Javascript can be really bad for accessibility if you're not careful

## Buttons v Links

Buttons are used for _actions that happen inside the page_

Links are used to _change the page_

## Clickable elements

Things that are not keyboard accessible should not have click events on them

Workaround is you can add `role="button" tabindex=0` to make it selectable

Or you can just but inside of a real button

### Logging key events
