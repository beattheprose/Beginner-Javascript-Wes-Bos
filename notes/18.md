## What is Hoisting?

Allows you to access functions and variables before they have been created

There are two things in js that are hoisted:

1. Function declarations
2. Variable declarations

So, you can call functions before they are used.

Usually, don't do this

### When it's useful

If you want to structure your files as `What does this file do?`, followed by `How does this file do it?` for better (opinionated) readability, you can call all functions first, then define them.
