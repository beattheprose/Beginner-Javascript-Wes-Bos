## What

Moving up in and around elements in the DOM

Nodes are everything in the DOM, while elements are only that which is surrounded by a HTML tag

Usually, traversal using parent elements and the like are not super useful, since if the HTML changes, your js is garbage

## List of useful traversal methods

- `.children`
- `.firstElementChild`
- `.lastElementChild`
- `.previousElementSibling`
- `.nextElementSibling`
- `.parentElement`

## Removing elements

You can call `.remove` on any node to get it out of the DOM

But, anything that you create in js will still be accessible in memory after `.remove` is called
