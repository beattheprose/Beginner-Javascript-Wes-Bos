## Pointer Events

in css, you can pass `pointer-events: none` to allow user to click underneath the object

`pointer-events: all` will do the opposite of the above

## Notes

Make sure to watch out for proper syntax inside `innerHTML`

`!` Will turn a string to a _not_ boolean:

```javascript
modalOuter.addEventListener(`click`, (e) => {
  const isOutside = !e.target.closest(`.modal-inner`);
  if (isOutside) {
    closeModal();
  }
});
```
