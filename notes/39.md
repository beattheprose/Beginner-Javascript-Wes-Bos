## Coercion

`!` will coerce an object's type to a boolean which is the opposite of that object's inherent truthiness

`!!` will coerce an object's type to a boolean which is the _same_ of that object's inherent truthiness

Coercion isn't as useful when you understand truthy and falsy

## Ternaries

Kind of like a shorthand `if` statement.

Needs:

- `if` statement
- what to do if it's true
- what to do if it's false

ex:

```javascript
let count;
const word = count === 1 ? `item` : `items`;
```

Can run functions based on ternaries:

```javascript
const isAdmin = true;
isAdmin ? showAdminBar() : null;
```

### And And Trick

When `&&` is nested inside an `if` statement, it will run and check each of the arguments inside, and if it reaches a false statement, the if statement will immediately move on to the `else`. This is called _short-circuiting_

```javascript
const isAdmin = true;
isAdmin && showAdminBar();
```

Some people _hate_ this tho

## Block-less `if` statement

If something is on the same line, you don't actually need the block, `{}`
