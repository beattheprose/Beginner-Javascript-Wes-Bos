Everything in js is an object

Allow us to group together keys and values together.

The order of keys in an object does not matter

If you pass in a variable with the same name as the correlated key, just put the variable name in the object:

```javascript
const age = 100;
const person = {
  age,
  name: `alex`,
};
```

Always put a trailing comma on the last entry to allow easier insertion of new key: object pairs in the future

Can overwrite the values in an object by passing `object.key = something else`

Can also reference a value in an object by invoking `object['key']`, which can be useful when you can only use strings to try to call a value in the object

`Object.freeze()` can be passed an object and will return a copy of that object with immutable key:value pairs.

Dot notation will take you as deep recursively as you need to go

`document.querySelector` for an element not on the page will return `null`

To get around this, you can do:

```javascript
const nameInput = document.querySelector(`[name="first"]`);
const name = nameInput ? nameInput.value : ``;
```

which will return the name if it exists and an empty string if it doesn't

you can call `delete object.key` to delete that key:value pair inside the object

## Methods

Methods are functions that live inside of objects

### `this`

Will always be to the left of the dot when you call `var.method()`

### Method shorthand

The following are equivalent:

```javascript
const alex = {
  lastname: function(name = `jackson`) {
    console.log(name);
  },
};
```

```javascript
const alex = {
  lastname(name = jackson) {
    console.log(name);
  },
};
```
