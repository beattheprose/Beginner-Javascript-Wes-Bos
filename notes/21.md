## Loading the JS

Again, make sure that you're including your `script` tag before th e ending `body` tag

You could also do

```javascript
function init() {
  const p = document.querySelector(`p`);
  console.log(p);
}
document.addEventListener(`DOMContentLoaded`, init);
```

to get around this limitation.

## Selecting Elements

`.querySelector` and `.querySelectorAll`

Both of these methods take CSS selectors (`<p>`, `<div>`, etc.)

`.querySelectorAll` returns a _NodeList_, which is slightly different than an array.

You can pass other things to `.querySelector`, e.g. `document.querySelector`, `window.querySelector`, etc
