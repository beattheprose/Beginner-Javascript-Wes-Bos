# Variables and statements

Anything (line) done in js is called a **statement**

## `Var` `Let` `Const`

Three different types of variables:

### `var`

**Function-scoped variable**

Can be updated

When redeclaring, do not have to put `var` again, e.g.:

```javascript
var first = "alex";
first = "westerhoff";
```

**Not**:

```javascript
var first = "alex";
var first = "westerhoff";
```

### `let`

**Block-scoped variable**

Can be updated

### `const`

**Block-scoped variable**

Means "constant".

Cannot be updated

## Rules (subjective)

use `const` by default
use `let` when you realize that you need to change a variable down the line
almost never use `var`

## Strict mode

Add `'use strict';` at the top of every file to help you when defining variables.

## Naming Conventions

variables should not start with a capital letter

use a-z but also can include `-`, `$`, or `_`

kebab case is _not allowed in js_, e.g. `this-is-kebab-case`

camel case is preferred by most people
