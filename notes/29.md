## Intro

Can attach to all elements, documents, and window.

`addEventListener` usually takes two arguments:

1. The kind of event you want to listen to
2. A callback function

### Callback function

A regular function

A function that we pass to a method, that will be called later in time

The _browser_ will call the function for you

### Writing these functions

A cool tip is to prefix these callback functions with "handle" to indicate that the browser will run it

Convienent way to add some global-ability to functions.

### `removeEventListener`

`.removeEventListener` must be passed the behavior you want to stop listening for, followed by the function that you want to remove

### Binding

Taking a function and relating it to an element, such as:

`butts.addEventListener(`click`, handleClick);`

**Note** that you won't be able to remove an event listener from a function that is anonymous! The browser doesn't know where to look!
