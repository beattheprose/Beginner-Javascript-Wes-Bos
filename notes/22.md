## Getting Properties

`console.dir()` will get you information about an element that you pass it. You can use methods or functions on the property information that comes out.

`.textContent` gives _everything_ inside the tag, while `.innerText` only gives the relevant, human readable content.

`.insertAdjacentElement`, `.insertAdjacentHTML`, `.insertAdjacentText` can help you append or prepend stuff to another element on your page

## Elements and nodes

Elements are things wrapped in tags, while nodes are the lines in the inspector
