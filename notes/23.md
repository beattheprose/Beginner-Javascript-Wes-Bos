# The DOM - Working with Classes <!-- omit in toc -->

- [Classes](#classes)
- [Example](#example)

## Classes

`.classList` will output an array of all the classes on that item and gives you a lot of other tools to use

Also has something called prototypes, which will list methods and functions that you can use on the element

A lot of the js interactions that we will use are just about adding and removing classes

## Example

```javascript
const pic = document.querySelector(`.nice`);
console.log(pic.classList);

const toggleRound = () => pic.classList.toggle(`round`);

pic.addEventListener(`click`, toggleRound);
```

```css
img {
  transition: all 0.2s;
}

.round {
  border-radius: 50%;
  transform: rotate(0.5turn);
}
```
