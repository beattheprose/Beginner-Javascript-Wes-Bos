## References

When you set a variable equal to an object, created variable is _referencing_ that originonal object.

Therefore all transformations that are done to that variable object will be done to the origional, reference object.

In js, objects and arrays are copied by references. The variable merely refernces the origional object

## Copying Objects

To copy an object, use the following syntax:

```javascript
const person3 = { ...person1 };
```

This is called **spreading**, since it will spread all of the things in person1 into person3.

However, spreading only does a **shallow copy**, i.e. one level deep

To deep copy, usually you use a library such as [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs)

[UNPKG][https://unpkg.com/] is an easy way to get files out of these libraries

## Merging objects

```javascript
const meatInventory = {
  bacon: 2,
  sausage: 5,
};
const veggieInventory = {
  lettuce: 2,
  tomatoes: 5,
};

const inventory = { ...meatInventory, ...veggieInventory };
```

Note that identical keys will be overwritten, so if there were identical key:value pairs in `meatInventory` and `veggieInventory`, the key:value pair in veggieInventory would be the only one kept since it was spread after `meatInventory`

## Functions

If you pass an object into a function, and modify that object within the function, the origional object will be modified as well
