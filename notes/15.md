# With `function`

The normal way

Functions defined with the `function` keyword are _hoisted_, in that they will be given highest priority

# Function Expressions

Basically, passing a function inside a variable:

```javascript
const doctorize = function(firstName) {
  return `Dr. ${firstName}`;
};
```

# Arrow Functions

A new addition to js.

Don't have their own scope in relation to the `this` keyword

Concise, shorter, easier to look at.

## How To Write

Delete `function`, go to the right of the parentheses and insert a "fat arrow" (`=>`)

```javascript
const doctorize = (firstName) => {
  return `Dr. ${firstName}`;
};
```

## Implicit Return

Delete the `{}`, then delete the `return`:

```javascript
const doctorize = (firstName) => `Dr. ${firstName}`;
```

## One-parameter

If there's only one parameter to your function, you can delete the `()` around the parameter:

```javascript
const doctorize = (firstName) => `Dr. ${firstName}`;
```

## Returning an object implicitly

```javascript
function makeABaby(first, last) {
  const baby = {
    name: `${first} ${last}`
    age: 0
  };
  return baby;
}
```

Will become:

```javascript
const makeABaby = (first, last) => ({ name: `${first} ${last}`, age: 0 });
```
