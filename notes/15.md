## With `function`

The normal way

Functions defined with the `function` keyword are _hoisted_, in that they will be given highest priority

## Function Expressions

Basically, passing a function inside a variable:

```javascript
const doctorize = function(firstName) {
  return `Dr. ${firstName}`;
};
```

The `function` that is inside the variable is called an _anonymous function_ because it has no name.

## Arrow Functions

A new addition to js.

Don't have their own scope in relation to the `this` keyword

Concise, shorter, easier to look at.

### How To Write

Delete `function`, go to the right of the parentheses and insert a "fat arrow" (`=>`)

```javascript
const doctorize = (firstName) => {
  return `Dr. ${firstName}`;
};
```

### Implicit Return

Delete the `{}`, then delete the `return`:

```javascript
const doctorize = (firstName) => `Dr. ${firstName}`;
```

### One-parameter

If there's only one parameter to your function, you can delete the `()` around the parameter:

```javascript
const doctorize = (firstName) => `Dr. ${firstName}`;
```

### Returning an object implicitly

```javascript
function makeABaby(first, last) {
  const baby = {
    name: `${first} ${last}`
    age: 0
  };
  return baby;
}
```

Will become:

```javascript
const makeABaby = (first, last) => ({ name: `${first} ${last}`, age: 0 });
```

## IIFE

> "Immediately Invoked Function Expression"

Take an anonymous function, then surround it with parentheses, then follow it up with a `()`, and you have a function that will run immediately:

```javascript
(function() {
  console.log(`Running the Anon function`);
  return `You are cool`;
})();
```

IIFE's have their own scope, jsyk.

## Methods

A function that lives inside of an object.

```javascript
const alex = {
  name: `Alex Jackson`,
  // Method
  sayHi: function() {
    console.log(`Hey Alex`);
    return `Hey Alex`;
  },
  //Short Hand Method
  sayHi() {
    console.log(`Hey Alex`);
    return `Hey Alex`;
  },
  //Arrow Function Method
  sayHi: () => {
    console.log(`Hey Alex`);
  },
};
```

In the above, we can call `alex.sayHi()`, and we will get back `Hey Alex`

## Callback Functions

Regular function, but something that will happen when something is done.

```javascript
const alex = {
  name: `Alex Jackson`,
  // Method
  sayHi() {
    console.log(`Hey Alex`);
  },
};

const button = document.querySelector(`.clickMe`);

button.addEventListener(`click`, alex.sayHi);
```

You can also include a function as an argument for your callback function:

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector(`.clickMe`);

button.addEventListener(`click`, function() {
  console.log(`Great Clicking!!!`);
});
```

Can do this for a lot of different things, including timers and stuff.
