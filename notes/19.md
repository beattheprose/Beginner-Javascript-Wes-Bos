## What are closures?

> The ability to access a parent-level scope from within the child scope, even after the parent has been terminated.

Any time a function is 'done,' we can't access the function scoped variables anymore _unless we use a closure._

It's not _garbage collected_

## Examples

```javascript
function createTheGreeting(greeting = ``) {
  const customGreeting = greeting.toUpperCase();
  return function(nomDePlume) {
    return `${customGreeting} ${nomDePlume}`;
  };
}

const hello = createTheGreeting(`hello`);
const hey = createTheGreeting(`hey`);
console.log(hello(`alex`));
console.log(hey(`alex`));
```

### Private Variables

```javascript
function gameCreate(gameName) {
  let score = 0;
  return function winner() {
    score++;
    return `Your game ${gameName} score is ${score}`;
  };
```

The above function will return different values for `score` depending on the `gameName` passed to it.
