`event` is a parameter that you can pass functions that gives you information about **what just happened**.

Commonly named `e` in functions

It is the first parameter that you pass `.addEventListener`

`target` and `currentTarget` can be passed to identify which thing was clicked.

> Remember `dataset` is the method used to grab data attributes

### Examples

```javascript
const buyButtons = document.querySelectorAll(`button.buy`);

const handleBuyButtonClick = (event) => {
  const el = event.target;
  console.log(el.textContent);
  console.log(parseFloat(event.target.dataset.price));
};

buyButtons.forEach((buyButton) => {
  buyButton.addEventListener(`click`, handleBuyButtonClick);
});
```

## `event.target` vs `event.currentTarget`

Comes in **nesting**

`event.target` is the thing that _actually got clicked_ while `event.currentTarget` is the _thing that fired the event listener_

## Propagation

It is possible to click on multiple things at the same time. This is called propagation

It's kind of like layers

Events will always _bubble up_ to the top level, unless you pas it the `.stopPropagation()` method.

### Capture

Kind of the opposite of bubbling up, it more like trickles down

You need to add a third argument to `addEventListener`:

```javascript
buyButtons.forEach((buyButton) => {
  buyButton.addEventListener(`click`, handleBuyButtonClick, { capture: true });
});
```

When you pass this argument, the order in which the listener will be fired will be from top to bottom

## Different types

`event.type` will give you click or whatever

`event.bubbles` returns a boolean that represents if the event will bubble up or not

## `this`

`this` is always going to be equal to whatever is left of the `.` in `addEventListener`

When you use arrow functions, `this` is not scoped to the arrow function

For the above reason, try not to use `this` in `addEventListener` because it might get wacky in that way.
