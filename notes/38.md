`!` is equivalent to a "not"

When checking is not equal, use the syntax `!==` vs `!=`

In `else if`, if the initial `if` is satisfied, then none of the rest of the conditional will run

`return` means return the statement from the function and _stop the function from running_

`==` checks if the values are the same, while `===` checks if the values are the same and the _types_ are the same

> you can use `==` to check if a variable is either null or undefined

`||` is for _or_

`&&` is for _and_

`.includes()` is a useful method that returns a boolean

Break up conditional logic into variables if the readability of your long conditional statements is low

## Truthiness

`if` statements will also take in statements that are truthy and falsy

`if` statements *coerce* their paramaters into truthy and falsy vlues

### Truthy Values

- Real numbers in (-inf,0)(0, inf)
- All non-empty strings
- All, even empty arrays
- All, even empty objects

### Falsy Values

- 0
- undefined
- null
- NaN
- empty string

## BEDMAS

Js follows BEDMAS for logic
