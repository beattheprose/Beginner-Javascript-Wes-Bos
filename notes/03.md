# Running and Loading JS

Always put your scripts before the closing `<body>` tag

There are a lot of js functions that need to check what's loaded on the page before they can run.

If there's a `src` attribute in your `<script>` tag, any code that is inside the tag won't load, it will only load the code referenced by `src`.
