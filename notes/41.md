# Intervals and Timeouts <!-- omit in toc -->

Use `setTimeout(callback, time(ms))` method to set a timeout, which is a globally-available method

`setInterval(callback, time(ms))` will run the callback every unit of time

setInterval won't run immediately, but only start the "clock" once the fist unit of time has passed. 

To stop timers from running, you first have to save reference to it in a variable, then call clearTimeout on that variable. There's no other way to do this.
