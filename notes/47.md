- [`debugger`](#debugger)

A way you can store your own methods is in the following way:

```javascript
const util = {
  findByWord(word) {
    return (i) => i.comment.includes(word);
  },
};
```

At this point `util.findByWord` is available and `.findByWord()` is a method that takes a word in and returns the item that includes the word.

`.filter()` will return array of all matches, while `.find()` will return the first match

For `.sort()`, you can custom sort ascending using `.sort((x,y) => x-y)` and sort descending using `.sort((x,y) => y-x)` since `.sort()` looks for negative and positive numbers as parameters.

## `debugger`

You can invoke `debugger` in the middle of your function do cause the debugger in the browser to fire once it's run. You cen then look under 'scope' in the browser to discover what the values for variables within the function are.
