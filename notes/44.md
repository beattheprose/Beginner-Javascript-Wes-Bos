## What is it?

Make a new map by calling `const myMap = new Map()`

Order, in a map, is guaranteed!

### `.set()`

How you pass an entry into the map, e.g. `myMap.set(key, value)`

The keys that you pass can be _any type_

### `.get()`

`.get()` takes a key and will return that key's value

### `.size()`

Grabs the size of a map

## Destructuring

If you say `const [key, value] = someMap`, `key` and `value` will be available as variables that correspond to the

## When?

When you need to maintain the order of your items

## `JSON.stringify`

Converts your object into a string.

Maps cannot be stringified in JSON. You would have to convert it to an object by passing it to `Object.fromEntries()`. This is not perfect though.
