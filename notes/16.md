## Console Methods

`console.warn()` logs to a warning

`console.error()` changes the error text

`console.table()` will output an object to a table inside the console

`console.count()` will count the number of times that it was executed in the file. You can also pass strings to this

`console.group()` groups all the console logs that are passed until `console.groupEnd()` is invoked

## Callstack, Stack Trace

Go _down_ the stack to track down the error

## Grabbing Elements

Typing `$0` in dev tools console will reference what you currently have selected inside the inspector, so you can pass it stuff like `$0.value`, or whatever

`$0` means "last element clicked", `$1` is the second-to-last element clicked, and so on

## Breakpoints

`debugger;` is a statement that will pause js from running when the dev tools are running.

## Network Requests

Find the network requests as they happen under the network tab

Click on the `Response` tab in FF to get a preview of what was requested

## Break on Attribute

Right click on the element that's being changed in the inspector, and then select `Break on > attribute modification`
