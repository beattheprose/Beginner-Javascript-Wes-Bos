- [intersection observer](#intersection-observer)

When you want to only run a funciton when a certain element is on the page, wrap it all in a function, then run an `if` that calls `return` if the function isn't on the page, in order to quit out of the wrapper function. Otherwise, the rest of the code you wrote will be executed.

## intersection observer

Finds out if something is currently viewable on the page.

> Callbacks are functions that will be called at a certain point
