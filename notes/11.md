# Types - Booleans and Equality

Booleans are either true or false.

## Equality

`=` is used for setting a variable

`==` Evaluates the boolean vale of the expression, _excluding the type_

`===` **Almost always use this.** Evaluates the boolean value of the expression, _also taking into account the types_:

```javascript
10 === 10;
true;

"10" === 10;
false;
```
